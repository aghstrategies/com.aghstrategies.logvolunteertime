About this Extension
--------------------
+ This Extension generates a form that allows anonymous users to log volunteer hours.

To Install:
----------
+ Have installed and enabled civiVolunteer 2.0 (which requires database updates and the Angular Profiles extension)
+ Enable the permissions "Access Ajax API" and "CiviVolunteer: Log Own Hours" for anonymous users for this page to work.
+ Need to include this pull request code for CiviVolunteer: https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.volunteer/pull/354
+ Any links that should take you to log hours for a certain event should look like this: civicrm/LogVolHours/vid = [Volunteer Project Id]
