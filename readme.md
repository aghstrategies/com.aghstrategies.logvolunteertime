Things to do:
------------

+ Write select2 code: https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/EntityRef+Fields
+ For reference for forms: https://git.aghstrategies.com/bike-austin/com.aghstrategies.classrequestform/blob/master/CRM/Classrequestform/Form/BikeEdRequest.php
+ Check on access arguments
+ Look into heirselect


Current Plan:
-------------

- set up select for volunteer project
- generate another select based on results of volunteer project that pulls needs (heirselect?)
- write create api call to log entered info.
- make sure permissioning is set up correctly
- test
